I woke up
I walked my dog Logan
I ate breakfast
I went to school
I went to period 1
I went to period 2
I went to period 3
I went to period 4
I went to period 5
I went to period 6
I went to period 7
Period 7 is my least favorite class
the final is friday, i hope i pass
I hate geometry, its not a lie
period 7 makes me want to cry. 

I went to period 8
I sat through some amazing classes
I came home from school
I walked Logan again
I ate dinner
I watched a movie
I went to sleep
